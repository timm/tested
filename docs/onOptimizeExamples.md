- Choose the parameters $\text{NP} \geq 4$, $\text{CR} \in [0,1]$, and $F \in [0,2]$. 
  - $\text{NP}$ =  population size, i.e. the number of candidate agents or "parents"; a typical setting is 10$n$. 
  - $\text{CR} \in [0,1]$ =  called the ''crossover probability'' 
  - $F \in [0,2]$ =  ''differential weight''.
  - Typical settings are $F = 0.8$ and $CR = 0.9$. 
- Create $\text{Gen}=\text{NP}$ individuals at random
- Until a termination criterion is met (e.g. number of iterations performed, or adequate fitness reached), repeat the following:
  - For each agent ${x} in \text{Gen}$ in the population do:
    - Pick any  ${a},{b},{c}\in\text{NP}$
    - Pick one attribute index $R$ at random
    - $y= \text{copy}(x)$
    - For each attribute $i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$
      - If $\text{rand}(0,1)<\text{CR}$ or $i=R$ then 
        - $y_i = a_i + F \times (b_i-c_i)$ 
    -  If $f({y}) \leq f({x})$ then replace ${x}$ in the population with $y$
-  Pick the agent from the population that has the best fitness and return it as the best found candidate solution.
