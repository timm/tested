# onGrid.lu

grid.lua implements an requirements engineering tool for finding tacit knowledge.

Repertory grids are a tool proposed by the  cognitive psychologist George Kelly as a method for eliciting  tacit knowledge. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kelly_(psychologist)):

- Kelly believed in a non-invasive or non-directive approach to psychotherapy.
- Rather than having the therapist interpret the person's psyche (which would amount to imposing the doctor's constructs on the patient)
- The therapist should just act as a facilitator of the patient finding his or her own constructs. 
- The patient's behavior is then mainly explained as ways to selectively observe the world, act upon it and update the construct system in such a way as to increase predictability. 
To help the patient find his or her constructs, Kelly developed the repertory grid interview technique.

Kelly explicitly stated that each individual's task in understanding their personal psychology is to put in order the facts of his or her own experience. 
- Then the individual, like the scientist, is to test the accuracy of that constructed knowledge by performing those actions the constructs suggest. 
- If the results of their actions are in line with what the knowledge predicted, then they have done a good job of finding the order in their personal experience. 
- If not, then they can modify the construct: their interpretations or their predictions or both. 
- This method of discovering and correcting constructs is roughly analogous to the general scientific method that is applied in various ways by 
   modern sciences to discover truths about the universe.

> "Who can say what nature is? Is it what now exists about us, including all the tiny hidden
things that wait so patiently to be discovered? Or is it the vista of all that is destined to occur,
whether tomorrow or in some distant eon of time? Or is nature, infinitely more varied than this,
the myriad trains of events that might ensue if we were to be so bold, ingenious, and irreverent
as to take a hand in its management?"<br>&nbsp;<br>
"Personal construct theory neither offers nor demands a firm answer to any of these questions, and in this respect it is unique. Rather than depending upon bedrock assumptions about
the inherent nature of the universe, or upon fragments of truth believed to have been accumulated, it is a notion about how man may launch out from a position of admitted ignorance, and
how he may aspire from one day to the next to transcend his own dogmatisms. It is, then, a
theory of man’s personal inquiry—a psychology of the human quest. It does not say what has
or will be found, but proposes rather how we might go about looking for it."    
-- George Kelly


- Nui and Easterbrook comment that repertory grids are widely recognized as a domain-independent method for externalizing individuals’ personal constructs. 

Interviewees are invited to offer their own examples from their own domain. 
- Then they are asked: “Given 3 examples (picked at random), on what dimension is one example most different to the other two?”
